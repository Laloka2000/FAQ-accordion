# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion

This is a challenge by Frontend Mentor. My Task is to build a FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the given design as possible.

The users are able to: 

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
